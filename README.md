# Graph Theory in ruby


This code is adapted from the theories presented in the book Graph Theory. They were adapted by me to the ruby language. This repository was made with the intention of realizing the learnings obtained in the book.

## Contents

The code goes through creation and other various graph algorithms.

- Simple graphs
- Directed graphs (digraphs)
- heavy graphs
- Generating trees from graphs
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search


## 100% code coverage


Although writing tests was not the purpose of the study. All code was elaborated with tests. All lines of code are tested in the spec files.
